# Tracking SPD Violence 2018 - Present

This R shiny web app is a data dashboard for exploring SPD violent encounters with the public. Three data sets were used to construct this web appoming from the [City of Seattle's Open Data Program](https://data.seattle.gov/). They are as follows: 

- [Terry Stops](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Terry-Stops/28ny-9ts8)
- [Use of Force](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj)
- [SPD Officer Involved Shooting (OIS) Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Officer-Involved-Shooting-OIS-Data/mg5r-efcm)

This project is still under construction and will be updated periodically.
